This is a small project I made to play around with new technologies I want hands-on experience with.
It is currently (2/23/18) just a list of monsters sortable by weakness with minimal monster elemental weakness profiles for quick reference while playing. It only includes monsters I have already fought & gathered info on myself in-game (to avoid spoiling my experience), so it is of very limited use to others for now.
I would eventually like to be able to input craftable wishlists which show what you need to do to acquire the needed ingredients. We will see whether my interest in the game outlasts the required development time.
